          - How much space does an integer occupy in memory?
        solutionVideo: http://bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/videoBucket/video.mp4
        solutions:
          - Think of a variable like an empty box where you can store anything. In programming, variables are a placeholder where you can store certian values
          - The fundamental data types are the basic forms of data a program can store. They are integer, string, boolean, float and double.
          - A string occupies 4bytes in memory
